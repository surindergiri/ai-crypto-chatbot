# Basics of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

## What is DeFi?
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies. The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services.

## Key Concepts
1. **DApps**: Decentralized applications are software applications that run on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network rather than a single computer.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.
3. **Liquidity Pools**: Crowdsourced pools of cryptocurrencies or tokens locked in a smart contract that facilitate trades between the assets on a decentralized exchange (DEX).

## Risks
- **Impermanent Loss**: A temporary loss of funds occurring when liquidity is provided to a pool.
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Bugs in the code can be exploited by hackers.
